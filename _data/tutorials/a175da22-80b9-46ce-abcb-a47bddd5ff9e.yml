  Apibara DNA is an open-source tool to stream on-chain data.

  Apibara are now launching *integrations* to quickly send Starknet data where itâ€™s needed. In the workshop they will show us what you can build using integrations and how to get started.


  In the workshop we will go through how to:


  * Stream Starknet data with Apibara and store it in a Postgres database

  * Build an API that uses ChatGPT to query data


  We will also learn:


  * What is Apibara DNA? How to use it?

  * What are integrations? What type of integrations exist?

  * How to use 1 or 2 integrations to build a real-world application.

  * How to contribute and add even more integrations.
