type: hackathon
name: ETHGlobal New York
description: "New York: The city that never sleeps when it comes to pushing the
  boundaries. Home to the largest stock exchange and traditional financial
  institutions, New York is rich in history and significance. But New York is
  also the dynamic hub of change to be reckoned with. A nurturing ground for
  disrupting the way we think, shaping how we engage with this new world - and
  reimagining a decentralized, distributed future.  Join us from September 22-24
  in one of the most iconic cities in the world. Hack with some of the most
  skilled web3 developers, designers and product builders from all around the
  globe for a weekend-long adventure to advance the Ethereum ecosystem. We hope
  the stunning views of Pier Sixty will inspire you to try your best as you get
  a chance to win over $500,000 USD in prizes! "
