description: We're happy to invite you to our first meet-up! We're having three
  presentations that will guide you through the world of Starknet, Layer 2, and
  formal verification. If you can't come in person, you can join the live stream
  (link soon).  What's the plan?  1. Tom Brand, Starkware TBA  2. Maksymilian
  Demitraszek, Software Mansion How not to lose millions by mistake?
  Introduction to formal verification Smart contracts often control critical
  assets. History shows that a tiny mistake by a developer may cause a lot of
  damage. Formal verification is a technique that can mitigate such risk.
  Instead of testing contract behavior in different scenarios, we can prove that
  the contract behaves exactly as defined in the specification. In this talk, we
  will briefly discuss underlying technology and the possible consequences for
  the whole blockchain ecosystem.  3. Antoni Pawlak, L2BEAT What is Layer 2?
  Introduction to scaling solutions deployed on Ethereum.  Stay for pizza, beer,
  and networking after the meetup!
