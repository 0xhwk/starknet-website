description: China First Starknet Workshop is Coming! In this Starknet Workshop,
  we will dive into Cairo, a general-purpose programming language for writing
  contracts on Starknet, and the Validity Rollup on Ethereum. This workshop aims
  to introduce participants to Cairo so they can build their own Cairo contracts
  from scratch.  This workshop is proudly hosted by Starknet Astro and
  co-sponsored by Starknet Site. We've invited experienced Starknet developers
  to discuss the fundamental concepts of the Cairo language and share practical
  coding techniques.
