type: meetup
name: Unearthing the Starknet Book "Cairo VM"
description: Blockchain is now intrinsic to our lives, with developers driving
  its evolution. Cairo, a language offering swift and practical blockchain
  tools, is emerging. This event targets tech students, particularly in Africa.
  We'll explore Cairo VM's math principles behind STARKs for creating Validity
  Proofs. Unlike EVM, Cairo VM isn't constrained. Join us for insights into
  Cairo programs, including BlockHeader Web3 academy, integrating Cairo lang in
  the 3rd cohort curriculum.
