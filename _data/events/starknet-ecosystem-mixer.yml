description: This cocktail mixer, co-hosted by the Starknet Foundation,
  StarkWare, Nethermind, and Lambda Class, is the perfect side-event to wrap up
  Day 3 of ETHCC.  ​Join us on the 19th of July from 6:30pm onwards for an
  unforgettable evening of networking, inspiration and fun at the beautiful Les
  Jardins Du Pont Neuf, Paris.  ​We're bringing together the industry's top
  builders and key figures within the Starknet ecosystem, making this the
  ultimate hub for established builders and Stark-curious individuals. This
  isn't about official talks or product demos; it's about making connections,
  celebrating progress, and getting hyped about the future.  ​The evening will
  feature some of our best in the ecosystem, an opportunity to meet with our
  notable partners - Braavos, ZkLend, AVNU, ZKX, StarkID, Cartridge, Voyager,
  Pragma Network, Carmine Finance, and Screenshot Labs.  ​If you're an existing
  builder, this is your chance to interface and meet the unbelievable teams
  behind the Starknet ecosystem.  ​For those of you who are builders to be,
  you're in for a huge surprise. Don't miss this. Register now.
