  evening for the first Starknet workshop in Amsterdam!  ZK-rollups like
  Starknet create huge amounts of data as they grow. Enter Apibara, an
  open-source web3 platform to stream and combine on-chain data.  Together with
  Francesco (@ceccon_me) we'll learn how to interact with data on Starknet using
  Apibara.
