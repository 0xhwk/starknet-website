      In the roadmap for Starknet in 2023, one of the key areas of development
      is the introduction of a fee market to improve user experience during
      network congestion. Currently, when congestion occurs, waiting times for
      transactions increase for everyone. To address this issue, Starknet plans
      to introduce a fee market in version 0.14.0. This fee market will allow
      for an efficient allocation of Starknet's limited resources based on
      users' willingness to pay for a transaction, rather than simply following
      the order of transactions in line. By implementing a fee market, Starknet
      aims to provide a more predictable and seamless experience for users, even
      during periods of high network activity.


      The introduction of a fee market is a tradeoff considered by the Starknet team. In version 0.13.0, they had to choose between lower transaction costs and better user experience with shorter and fixed block intervals. They decided to prioritize lower transaction costs, as they expect the improvements in latency from version 0.12.0 to result in significantly better user experience. The main lever for reducing transaction costs will be the introduction of Volition, a hybrid Data Availability (DA) mode that allows both on-chain and off-chain data. Additionally, the upcoming Ethereum EIP-4844 (Shard Blob Transaction) and the integration of Volition are expected to contribute to a dramatic reduction in the cost of data for Starknet transactions.


      Overall, the roadmap for Starknet in 2023 emphasizes enhancing performance and user experience. By improving throughput, reducing transaction costs, and introducing a fee market, Starknet aims to provide developers and users with a stable, efficient, and predictable network for building and using applications. These improvements are expected to attract more developers and applications to Starknet while setting the stage for decentralization in the future.
