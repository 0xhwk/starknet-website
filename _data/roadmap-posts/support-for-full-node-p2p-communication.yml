      I﻿n Starknet version 0.12.0.1 we are introducing a new endpoint to the
      Starknet feeder gateway which will return a signature on the
      *state_diff_commitmant+block_hash* value. T﻿his change will facilitate
      full node P2P communication.   


      We are also making further optimizations to the stack which will result in another increase in throughput and performance.
