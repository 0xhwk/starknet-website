      As part of its roadmap, Starknet aims to significantly reduce transaction
      costs. 

      Currently, L1 (Ethereum) data cost accounts for the majority (95%) of transaction costs on Starknet. EIP-4844 is a step towards full data sharding on Ethereum. This EIP, together with the supporting changes in Starknetâ€™s protocol, should result in a reduction in the cost of Starknet data storage on L1.


      For more information, see [EIP-4844: Shard Blob Transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) on the Ethereum Improvement Protocols site.
