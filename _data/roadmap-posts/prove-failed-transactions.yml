      In the roadmap for Starknet in 2023, there is a focus on addressing the
      issue of prove failed transactions to enhance the user experience on the
      network. Currently, if a transaction fails to produce a proof within a
      specified time frame, it is considered a prove failed transaction. This
      can occur due to various reasons such as network congestion or transaction
      complexity.


      To improve this aspect, Starknet plans to introduce a fee market in version 0.14.0. This fee market will allow for an efficient allocation of Starknet's limited resources based on users' willingness to pay for a transaction. By introducing a fee market, Starknet aims to mitigate congestion-related issues and reduce the occurrence of prove failed transactions, ensuring a more reliable and predictable network experience for users.


      This decision to introduce a fee market reflects the prioritization of user experience on Starknet. By addressing prove failed transactions, the network aims to provide a smoother transaction processing flow and minimize frustrating experiences for users. As a result, developers and users can expect a more seamless and efficient environment for building and interacting with applications on Starknet.
